# Portfolio  
Portfolio showcasing some of my personal projects I have worked on.  
For the development process I have mostly used Unity (game engine) and coded in C#.  

## Car Park Mania - *Currently working on*
*About*  
The aim of the project is to get more familiar with the game engine and to progress my skills, going through all the steps of making it and at the end have a finished product that I am happy with.

The idea came from playing the game Unblock Me and the board game Rush Hour. I wanted to create a unique theme and from experiencing/watching what happens when an emergency vehicle needs to go through traffic. They turn on the siren and lights and everyone gives way for the vehicle to pass. And with that in mind the goal of every level is to clear the path for the emergency vehicle to pass through.

*Things I would like to add to the game:*  
 - Different game modes, currently only have casual/standard  
   - Mode where the goal is to clear the path in the shortes time.  
   - Mode where the goal is to clear the path with minimal moves.

## PinballFall
*About*  
The aim of the project was to get familiar with mobile game development and of course progress my skils.  

The idea came from scrolling through the app store taking a look at what the big video game companies were doing. Most of the games had a pretty simple goal and a fairly easy game mechanichs that are easy to pick up. Then I remembered a game that I used to play when I was younger called Pinball. The game mechanics are pretty simple to pick up and the goal is simple, but it can create frustration that you don't have full control of where the ball goes.  

*Game mechanics*  
The goal is to score as many points in a level as possible. Score is gained from hitting obstaccles. You select where you want to drop the ball by pressing and moving your finger. To drop the ball you let go. At that point you can tilt your phone left and right to try and control the ball.

*Things I would like to add to the game*  
 - Arcade mode  
   - fx. play the pinball game, using current game mechanics of having full control over the ball  
 - Difficulty  
   - fx. Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert  
 - Post processing  
   - Make the game look nicer  

*Game development*  
The process was made over 2 week period in 2019. I got the game to a position where there was not much left to do, mostly what was left was to clean things up and create levels. I didn't have a good reason to finish the game as I didn't have a place to publish it. This might be a project I might pick up sometime in the future and finish.

## Knights2D  
*About*  
This was the first game that I made where I tried creating something that I wanted to play myself. The idea came from playing rpg games and I really thought that there was something missing for mobile. The first idea was ofcourse a game that was both 3D and multiplayer, but since I didn't have the knowledge and time to do either of those I had to settle on doing 2D and single-player. Altough not my first choice I thought that it brought something of a unique element to it.

The game is a mobile rpg game where you play as a knight that has been tasked with banishing evil from the lands. The player goes on quests, leveling, combating enemies, looting and everything that comes with a 'classic' rpg game.

*Game mechanics*  
User has buttons to control his movement and attack or block. There's a quick access bar at the bottom used for qunsumables and spells/skills.

*Things I would like to add to the game*  
- Most of the world has not been developped and that's a good place to start
- Spells/skills have not been implemented
- Create more monsters
- Create a loot table
- Save/load system
- and many more

*Game development*  
The game was made over the summer of 2018. I kind of got a little bit overwhelmed with the project and really didn't see an endpoint with it. This got me a little discouraged and after a little while I started to realise that what I had planned was quite a big project and was in need of more knowledge of the game engine to continue development. It ended up being shelved but could be an interesting project to return to in a few years time when I might be at the point where I could finally see it through. 

## My first project  
*About*  
This was my starting project for getting to learn Unity and programmin in C#.

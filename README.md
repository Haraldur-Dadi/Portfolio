# Portfolio  
Portfolio showcasing some of my personal projects I have worked on.  
In my personal projects I have mostly worked with Unity (game engine) and coding in C#.  

### Car Park Mania - *Currently working on*
*About*  
The aim of the project is to get more familiar with the game engine and to progress my skills, going through all the steps of making it and at the end have a finished product that I am happy with.

The idea came from playing the game Unblock Me and the board game Rush Hour. I wanted to create a unique theme and from experiencing/watching what happens when an emergency vehicle needs to go through traffic. They turn on the siren and lights and everyone give way for the vehicle to pass. And with that in mind the goal of every level is to clear the path for the emergency vehicle to pass through.  

*Things I would like to add to the game:* 
 - Different game modes, currently only have casual/standard
  -- Mode where the goal is to clear the path in the shortes time.
  -- Mode where the goal is to clear the path with minimal moves.

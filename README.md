# Portfolio  
Portfolio showcasing some of my personal projects I have worked on.  
In my personal projects I have mostly worked with Unity (game engine) and coding in C#.  

### Car Park Mania  
- About  
The aim of the project is to get more familiar with the game engine and to progress my skills, going through all the steps of making it and at the end have a finished product that I am happy with.

The idea came from playing the game Unblock Me and the board game Rush Hour. I wanted to create a unique theme and from experiencing/watching what happens when an emergency vehicle needs to go through traffic I had it. And with that in mind the goal of every level is to clear the path for the emergency vehicle to pass through.

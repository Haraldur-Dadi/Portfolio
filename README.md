# Portfolio  
Portfolio showcasing some of my personal projects I have worked on.  
For the development process I have mostly used Unity (game engine) and coded in C#.  

### Car Park Mania - *Currently working on*
*About*  
The aim of the project is to get more familiar with the game engine and to progress my skills, going through all the steps of making it and at the end have a finished product that I am happy with.

The idea came from playing the game Unblock Me and the board game Rush Hour. I wanted to create a unique theme and from experiencing/watching what happens when an emergency vehicle needs to go through traffic. They turn on the siren and lights and everyone gives way for the vehicle to pass. And with that in mind the goal of every level is to clear the path for the emergency vehicle to pass through.

*Things I would like to add to the game:*  
 - Different game modes, currently only have casual/standard  
  - Mode where the goal is to clear the path in the shortes time.  
  - Mode where the goal is to clear the path with minimal moves.

### PinballFall
*About*  
The aim of the project was to get familiar with mobile game development and of course progress my skils.  

The idea came from scrolling through the app store taking a look at what the big video game companies were doing. Most of the games had a pretty simple goal and a fairly easy game mechanichs that are easy to pick up. Then I remembered a game that I used to play when I was younger called Pinball. The game mechanics are pretty simple to pick up and the goal is simple, but it can create frustration that you don't have full control of where the ball goes.

*Things I would like to add to the game*  
 - Arcade mode
 -- fx. play the pinball game, using current game mechanics of having full control over the ball
 - Difficulty
 -- fx. Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert
 - Post processing
 -- Make the game look nicer

*Game development*  
The process was made over 2 week period in 2019. I got the game to a position where there was not much left to do, mostly what was left was to clean things up and create levels. I didn't have a good reason to finish the game as I didn't have a place to publish it. This might be a project I might pick up sometime in the future and finish.
